# udacity-ML-course-mini-projects
This is a working version of Udacity's introduction to Machine Learning course's mini project code.
the mini project was initially designed for python 2 but currently it cannot be run in python 2. It is because that numpy has retracted 
it's support for python 2. So this code is converted into python 3. 
I could not upload the full project here because of the full code has a large dataset and can not be uploaded in git.
you can find the full working code in :
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tar.gz
download this file and then replace it's files with this git files.
You will have a working code
